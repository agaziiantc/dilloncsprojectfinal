The code for my project for Annual Intro Comp Sci class with James Dillon
it's a bullet hell game 
use arrow keys to move
use shift to dash (temporarily makes you immune to damage)

Currently has three levels:
Red circle-the thing I made when first designing the game, very bad, will be removed when it is time to present this
Orange circle-red circle if it was good
Green circle-Devourer of Gods from Terraria bossfight
